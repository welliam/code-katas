My katas from Codewars.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/welliam/code-katas.svg?branch=distance-between-points)](https://travis-ci.org/welliam/code-katas)

The flight_paths.py file includes a function `shortest_distance` which
can be used to determine the shortest path between two cities. It
returns a path made up of cities and the associated distance.
